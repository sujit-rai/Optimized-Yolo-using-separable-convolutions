This project contains analysis of various techniques such as separable convolutions(MobileNet) and grouped convolutions (ShuffleNet) using concatenation and addition for skip connections




Instructions :

yolodws_concat.py contains the code for depthwise separable convolution with concatenation

yolodws_concat_predict.py contains the code for prediction




extras:
yolodws_add.py contains the code for depthwise separable convolution with addition
basicyolo.py contains the code of actual un optimized network
shuffle.py contains the code for grouped convolutions using shuffle technique.
